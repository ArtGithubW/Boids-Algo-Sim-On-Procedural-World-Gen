# Boids-Algo-Sim

## Dependencies

pip install pygame <br/>
pip install pygame_gui

### This repo contains the boids algorithm simulated on pygame.

- 3 Main concepts:

1. Seperation(To make each boid not collide with eachother)
2. Alignment(To make boids align with other boids' forward velocity)
3. Cohesion(To make the boids move to the center of the flock)
