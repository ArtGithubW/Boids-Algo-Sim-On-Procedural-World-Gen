# Boids Algorithm Simulation on Procedural Generated World

## Dependencies

pip install pygame <br/>
pip install pygame_gui <br/>
pip install numpy

## 3 Main concepts of Boid:

1. Seperation(To make each boid not collide with eachother)
2. Alignment(To make boids align with other boids' forward velocity)
3. Cohesion(To make the boids move to the center of the flock)

### Notes:

- TODO LIST:

* figure out the numpy inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimension problem that is not consistent
* Combining the avoid extreme terrains function to main code
